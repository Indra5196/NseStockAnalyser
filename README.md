NSE Stock Market Analyser in a python based tool which makes use of "nsetools" and requests api to fetch stock data in json format. In the initial version, I am supporting a basic option chain analysis, which gives the max call point, max put point and max pain point of a derivative. I will also be supporting Put/Call ratio, nth order support points and nth order pain points, and many more advanced features
