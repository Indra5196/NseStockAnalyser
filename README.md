NSE Stock Market Analyser in a python based tool which makes use of "nsetools", "NSEpy" and requests api to fetch stock data in json format.
Currently Supported features are:-
1. Option Chain Analysis
2. Put/Call Ratio
3. Open Interest Graphs

I will be supporting more useful features which is sometimes difficult to find on the internet in an easy format.
